    // Let's say we have an array
    const players = ['Wes', 'Sarah', 'Ryan', 'Poppy'];
    const team  = players;
    console.log(players,team);
    // and we want to make a copy of it.

    // You might think we can just do something like this:

    // however what happens when we update that array?

    // now here is the problem!

    // oh no - we have edited the original array too!

    // Why? It's because that is an array reference, not an array copy. They both point to the same array!

    // So, how do we fix this? We take a copy instead!
    const team2 = players.slice();
    team2[1] = 'aaaaa';
    console.log(team2);
    // one way

    // or create a new array and concat the old one in

    const team3 = [].concat(players);
    team3[2] = 'bbbbbbb';
    console.log(team3);
    // or use the new ES6 Spread
    const team4 = [...players];
    team4[0] = 'ccccc';
    console.log(team4);

    const team5 = Array.from(players);
    team5[2] = 'ddddd';
    console.log(team5);
    console.log(players);
    // now when we update it, the original one isn't changed

    // The same thing goes for objects, let's say we have a person object

    // with Objects
    const person = {
      name: 'Wes Bos',
      age: 80
    };

    // and think we make a copy:

    // how do we take a copy instead?
    const person1 = Object.assign({}, person, {number: 99, age: 23});
    console.log(person1);
    // We will hopefully soon see the object ...spread

    // Things to note - this is only 1 level deep - both for Arrays and Objects. lodash has a cloneDeep method, but you should think twice before using it.
